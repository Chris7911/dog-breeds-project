## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Deep learning helps me solve lots of problems in my work, but putting a deep learning application on a web app is something I've never done before. So, that's why choosing this dog breed classifier as Data Scientist Nanodegree's capstone project to further my skill! This project might help host my other deep learning application on a website for more people to use in the near future.
